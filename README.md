# ramdom-spilt-algorithm
We implement splitting method to reduce dimensionality of differential equation and applied it on several examples. The main idea of the algorithm is to use iteration to approximate power of differential operator. Implicit Eulerâ€™s polygonal arc method were used to solve equations. The error were finally controlled in square degree.
